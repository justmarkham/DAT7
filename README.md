    * It is not necessary to download "GitHub for Windows" or "GitHub for Mac"
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
    * If you choose not to use Anaconda, here is a list of the [Python packages](other/python_packages.md) you will need to install during the course.
* Once you receive an email invitation from Slack, join our "DAT7 team" and add your photo.
* Practice Python using the resources below.
* Attend one or both of our Python workshops, depending on your current skill level: [beginner](https://generalassemb.ly/education/intro-to-python-programming/washington-dc/12239) (Saturday 5/16 10am-2pm) and [intermediate](https://generalassemb.ly/education/python-for-data-science-intermediate/washington-dc/12242) (Saturday 5/30 10am-2pm).
* We would like to check the setup of your laptop before the course begins.
    * You can have your laptop checked after the intermediate Python workshop on Saturday 5/30 (2pm-3pm), at the [15th & K Starbucks](http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-washington-15) on Sunday 5/31 (11am-1pm), or before class on Monday 6/1 (5pm-6:30pm).
    * Alternatively, you can walk through the [setup checklist](other/setup_checklist.md) yourself. In this case, please post a message in the "setupchecklist" channel in Slack noting whether or not you had any issues.

### Submission Forms
* [Feedback form](http://bit.ly/dat7feedback)
* [Homework and project submissions](http://bit.ly/dat7homework)

-----

### Class 1: Introduction to Data Science
* Welcome from General Assembly staff
* Course overview ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Introduction to data science ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Discuss the [course project](project/README.md)
* Types of data ([slides](slides/01_types_of_data.pdf)) and [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
* Wrap up: Slack tour, submission forms

**Homework:**
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows), and then browse through this [command line reference](code/02_command_line.md).
* Watch videos 1 through 8 (21 minutes) of [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD).
* If your laptop has any setup issues, please work with us to resolve them by Wednesday.

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.
* Keep up with local data-related events through the Data Community DC [event calendar](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar) or [weekly newsletter](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/newsletter).

-----

### Class 2: Command Line and Version Control
* Command line exercise ([code](code/02_command_line.md))
* Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Intermediate command line
* Wrap up: Course schedule, office hours

**Homework:**
* Complete the homework exercise listed in the [command line introduction](code/02_command_line.md#homework-exercise). Create a Markdown document that includes your answers and the code you used to arrive at those answers. Add this file to a GitHub repo that you'll use for all of your coursework, and submit a link to your repo using the homework submission form.
* Review the code from the [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshops. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (up through the "dictionaries" section), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python. Here are my recommended resources:
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try these much longer lessons from [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/missions): "Find the US city with the lowest crime rate" and "Discover weather patterns in LA".
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving the second [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) and send me your code in Slack.
* If there are specific Python topics you want me to cover next week, send me a Slack message.

**Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via `pip`.

### Class 3: Data Reading and Cleaning
* Git and GitHub assorted tips ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Review command line homework ([code](code/02_command_line.md#homework-exercise))
* Python:
    * Spyder interface
    * Review of list comprehensions
    * Lesson on file reading with airline safety data (code, [data](data/airlines.csv), [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/))
    * Data cleaning exercise
    * Walkthrough of homework with Chipotle order data (code, [data](data/chipotle.tsv), [article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html))
* Course project:
    * [Example projects](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples)
    * Project question exercise

**Homework:**
* Complete the homework assignment with the Chipotle data, and add a commented Python script to your GitHub repo. If you are unable to complete a part, try writing some pseudocode instead! You have until Monday to complete this assignment.

**Resources:**
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.
