* Keep up with local data-related events through the Data Community DC [event calendar](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar) or [weekly newsletter](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/newsletter).

-----

### Class 2: Command Line and Version Control
* Command line exercise ([code](code/02_command_line.md))
* Git and GitHub ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
* Intermediate command line
* Wrap up: Course schedule, office hours

**Homework:**
* Complete the homework exercise listed in the [command line introduction](code/02_command_line.md#homework-exercise). Create a Markdown document that includes your answers and the code you used to arrive at those answers. Add this file to a GitHub repo that you'll use for all of your coursework, and submit a link to your repo using the homework submission form.
* Review the code from the [beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) Python workshops. If you don't feel comfortable with any of the content (up through the "dictionaries" section), you should spend some time this weekend practicing Python. Here are my recommended resources:
    * If you like learning from a book, [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270/) has useful chapters on strings, lists, and dictionaries.
    * If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
    * If you have more time, try these much longer lessons from [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/missions): "Find the US city with the lowest crime rate" and "Discover weather patterns in LA".
    * If you've already mastered these topics and want more of a challenge, try solving the second [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) and send me your code in Slack.
* If there are specific Python topics you want me to cover next week, send me a Slack message.

**Git and Markdown Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.

**Command Line Resources:**
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032823.do) is a great book. The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox" (a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via `pip`.

    * Lesson on file reading with airline safety data ([code](code/03_file_reading.py), [data](data/airlines.csv), [article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/))
    * Data cleaning exercise
    * Walkthrough of homework with Chipotle order data ([code](code/03_python_homework_chipotle.py), [data](data/chipotle.tsv), [article](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html))

**Homework:**
* Complete the [homework assignment](code/03_python_homework_chipotle.py) with the [Chipotle data](data/chipotle.tsv), and add a commented Python script to your GitHub repo. If you are unable to complete a part, try writing some pseudocode instead! You have until Monday to complete this assignment.

**Resources:**
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.

-----

**Resources:**
* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.

* If you're not using Anaconda, [install the IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/install.html) using `pip`. (The IPython Notebook comes with Anaconda.)
* If you're not using Anaconda, [install Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/installing.html) using `pip`. If you're using Anaconda, install Seaborn by running `conda install seaborn` at the command line.
* Watch this brief introduction to [scikit-learn and the IPython Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsXXlYVBt1M) (15 minutes), and try to follow along with the Notebook introduction on your own computer.
* Read Kevin's [introduction to reproducibility](http://www.dataschool.io/reproducibility-is-not-just-for-researchers/), read Jeff Leek's [guide to creating a reproducible analysis](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), and watch this related [Colbert Report video](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/dcyvro/austerity-s-spreadsheet-error) (8 minutes).

**API Resources:**
* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore) and [Apigee](https://apigee.com/providers) allow you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a [Python API wrapper](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/api/list-of-python-apis) is available for many popular APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* Microsoft's [Face Detection API](https://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/face#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](http://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.

**Web Scraping Resources:**
* The [Beautiful Soup documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is incredibly thorough, but is hard to use as a reference guide. However, the section on [specifying a parser](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) may be helpful if Beautiful Soup appears to be parsing a page incorrectly.
* For more Beautiful Soup examples and tutorials, see [Web Scraping 101 with Python](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/), Alex's well-commented notebook on [scraping Craigslist](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Alexjmsherman/DataScience_GeneralAssembly/blob/master/Final_Project/1.%20Final_Project_Data%20Scraping.ipynb), this [notebook](http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html) from Stanford's Text As Data course, and this [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/2014/blob/master/lectures/2014_09_23-lecture/data_scraping_transcript.ipynb) and associated [video](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2015/01/14328/L07/screen_H264LargeTalkingHead-16x9.shtml) from Harvard's Data Science course.
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHM_esB13VuSf7O1ScGueisnrtu-6usGFD3fs4z5YCE/edit#slide=id.p) and [code](https://github.com/kjam/python-web-scraping-tutorial) are also available.
* For more complex web scraping projects, [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a popular application framework that works with Python. It has excellent [documentation](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/1.0/index.html), and here's a [tutorial](https://github.com/rdempsey/ddl-data-wrangling) with detailed slides and code.
* [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) has a concise explanation of how to write (and read) the `robots.txt` file.
* [import.io](https://import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code.
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid to Find True Love](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.
